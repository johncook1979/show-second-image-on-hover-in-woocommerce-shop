# Show second image on WooCommerce shop and archive page on hover
Show a second image on hover in the WooCommerce shop and archive page.

These short snippets will allow you to display a second image from your product on your shop and archive pages. Some class names may be different in your theme, so make any changes as necessary. If you have a product with only the main image, the code will not apply any changes. The screenshot below shows the hover effect on products with the 4th product not changing as it only has 1 main image and no additional gallery images
