# Show second image on WooCommerce shop and archive page on hover
Show a second image on hover in the WooCommerce shop and archive page.

These short snippets will allow you to display a second image from your product on your shop and archive pages. Some class names may be different in your theme, so make any changes as necessary. If you have a product with only the main image, the code will not apply any changes.
